# 🏘️ US-Real-Estate-Market-Analysis
This project explores profitable real estate investment opportunities in the U.S. housing market using Zillow's publicly available housing data. With a $12 million investment budget, our goal is to identify the best U.S. regions for purchasing, upgrading, and renting or selling single-family homes or rental apartments.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository highlights my contribution to a collaborative real estate investment analysis project. The objective was to assess the U.S. real estate market using Zillow’s publicly available housing data and provide data-driven recommendations on where and how to invest **$12 million** for optimal returns.

Each team member individually analyzed a specific question related to real estate trends and investment decisions. I focused on:

- **Q2: Are sale prices and inventory listings going up or down in the U.S.?**
- **Q5: What profit can be expected from property sales after paying the mortgage? (Sale ROI)**
- **Q6: What monthly income can be expected from rental properties after expenses? (Rental ROI)**

This repository contains my **code, visualizations, and conclusions** for these questions including other members analysis on thier questions, presented in a Jupyter Notebook format using Python and Zillow datasets.

## 🔍 My Contributions

### 🏠 Q2: Are Sale Prices and Inventory Listings Going Up or Down?

#### 🔎 Key Findings:
- **Median Sale Price** (as of March 2025): $356,140 (+3.23% YoY)
  - Indicates continued demand and moderate appreciation.
- **Inventory Listings**: Up by **+17.69%** from the previous year.
  - Suggests increased supply, possibly due to sellers capitalizing on high prices.
  
#### 📌 Conclusion:
- The U.S. housing market remains **robust** but may be entering a **cooling phase**.
- Investors face a **more competitive but opportunity-rich environment**.
- It’s crucial to monitor local shifts to anticipate price stabilization or surges.

### 💰 Q5: Sale-Based ROI After Paying Mortgage

In this section, I developed a financial model to estimate profits from buying, upgrading, and selling properties.

#### 🧮 My Approach:
- Estimated mortgage payments (30-year fixed @ 6.5% interest).
- Modeled appreciation over 5 years.
- Included upgrade costs and selling fees.
- Focused on regions like **Niles, MI** and **Lebanon, PA**.

#### 📌 Conclusion:
- Short-term investments (1–2 years) in select markets can still yield **positive ROI**.
- Must avoid regions with **high property taxes or flat price trends**.
- Regular monitoring of mortgage rates and market shifts is essential.

### 📈 Q6: Rental Income ROI After Mortgage & Expenses

I evaluated **net rental returns** after considering mortgage, taxes, and potential vacancy/maintenance costs.

#### 🔍 Key Findings:
- **Top Region**: **Florence, SC** with a rental ROI of **5.54%**.
  - Benefits from low property tax (0.47%) and good rent-to-value ratio.
- **Negative ROI Regions**: Occurred where:
  - Mortgage payments exceeded rent income.
  - High taxes and maintenance costs eroded profits.

#### 📌 Conclusion:
- Investors should prioritize regions with **moderate home prices, low taxes, and sustainable rents**.
- High rental income alone doesn’t guarantee ROI—expenses must be carefully modeled.
- Include **vacancy rates** and **management fees** to reflect true net income.
